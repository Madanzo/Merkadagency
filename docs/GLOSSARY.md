### Idempotency Key
Unique identifier for API requests to prevent duplicate operations on retry.

### Job
Unit of work processed by a worker (e.g., "generate-storyboard", "render-video").

### LUFS (Loudness Units Full Scale)
Measurement of audio loudness. Target: -16 LUFS for broadcast/streaming.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Anthropic's protocol for integrating external services with AI systems. Used here generically for "service integration".

### Mock Adapter

### Scene
Individual segment of video (2-4 seconds). Has image, text overlay, voiceover, and duration.

### Shadcn/ui

### Storyboard
Sequence of scenes describing video structure. Generated by Director agent.

### TTS (Text-to-Speech)
